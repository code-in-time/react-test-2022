# This is a react test

## Instruction notes

- Install the node modules with ```npm install```

- To run the react app ```npm start```

- Browser URL ```http://localhost:9000```

- The API ```http://localhost:9001/api/payments```

## How it works

- [LOAD FRESH DATA] button load the data for the first time
- If [Show pending approval only] is checked then Pending Approval data is hidden from the table
- [CLEAR] button will rest
- [LOAD NEXT PAGE KEY] button will load the next page. The key is added to prove that moves to the next page


### TODO
- Find out if there are spelling mistakes in the properties ```metaDatal``` and ```toAccaunt```
- Add loading spinner
- Improve design/layout
- Keep table header so that they always float on top when user scrolls
- Add more filters so that the more data can be filtered
- Add a search
- Add copy text function
- Add environment variables
- Add jest test
- Use a real API
- Add error handling
- Detect when the server is not running
- Use eslint on the code
- Improve variable names
- Run ```npm audit fix```
